# elevator-project
Elevator project for Outside Analytics. This program assumes that the elevator travels to floors in the order the user entered, rather than stopping at floors on the way up or down.

To run, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine. Then, use the following command: "java -jar ElevatorTimer.jar"
